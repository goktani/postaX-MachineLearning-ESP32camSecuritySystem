# postaX-MachineLearning-ESP32camSecuritySystem

## Project Overview

This repository contains an Arduino-based security system project using the ESP32-CAM module. The system is designed for simple motion or object detection, making it ideal for monitoring mailboxes, front doors, or other entry points. All code is in Arduino (.ino) format, ready to upload from the Arduino IDE.
